# This assignment will give you practice using the TDD approach.

    * In your Week 1 folder, create a folder called ‘fizzbuzz’ for this assignment.
    * Create a project fizzbuzz using pycharm IDE.
    * Create a Fizzbuzzunittest.py file
    * The Fizzbuzz.py file should be able to achieve following tests:
        - I can call FizzBuzz
        - Get “1” when I pass in 1
        - Get “2” when I pass in 2
    * In the fizzbuzzunittest.py file, write a code that should achieve above tests through failing test, all the way to refractor.
