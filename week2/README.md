# FizzBuzzKata 

    > We will be implementing a function that will pass an integer as in input. Function will return “fizz” if the passed in number is multiple of “3” , “buzz” if the pass in number is multiple of “5”, and “fizzbuzz” if the passed in number is multiple of “3” & “5”.

    1. In your Week 2 folder, create a folder called ‘fizzbuzzkata’ for this assignment.
    2. Create a project called fizzbuzzkata
    3. Create a Fizzbuzzkataunittest.py file
    4. The Fizzbuzzkataunittest.py file should be able to achieve the following tests:
        *  Can I call FizzBuzz
        *  Get “1” when I pass in 1
        *  Get “2” when I pass in 2
        *  Get “Fizz” when I pass in 3
        *  Get “Buzz” when I pass in 5
        *  Get “Fizz” when I pass in 6 (a multiple of 3)
        *  Get “Buzz” wen I pass in 10 (a multiple of 5)
        *  Get “FizzBuzz” when I pass in 15 (a multiple of 3 and 5)
    4. In the fizzbuzzkataunittest.py file, write a code that should achieve above tests through failing test, production test and the refractor test.
